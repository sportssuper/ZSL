    ● Neuromuscular Fatigue & Load Monitoring<br>
    Use countermovement jump (CMJ) testing to assess player readiness. Metrics such as RSI Mod, FT:CT, jump height, and impulse detect neuromuscular fatigue, distinguish between acute and chronic training load responses, and inform adjustments to training intensity.<br>
    ● Recovery Tracking & Performance Optimization<br>
   Monitor post-training and post-competition recovery through CMJ and related measures, helping to prevent overtraining, optimize recovery strategies, and guide evidence-based training decisions.
<br>
    ● Physical Performance Correlation<br>
   Analyze relationships between CMJ performance and sprint speed, maximal strength (1RM), and explosive power, providing a reliable marker of overall athletic readiness for competition and targeted physical development.
